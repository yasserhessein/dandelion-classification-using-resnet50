# Trained Dandelion images classification models using ResNet50


### ResNet50

ResNet50 is a variant of ResNet model which has 48 Convolution layers along with 1 MaxPool and 1 Average Pool layer. It has 3.8 x 10^9 Floating points operations. It is a widely used ResNet model and we have explored ResNet50 architecture in depth.

### Description

These are images of dandelions and not-dandelions. Basically grass or other. Goal of this project/images is a very simple binary image classification model for me to do some "real world learning": - Dandelions - Anything NOT dandelions

1- Images/dandelions = only images of dandelions.

2-Images/other = other, mostly grass images.

3-Images/dandelionvother = kinda' a mistake this dir gets created during training. Should be cleared out on each training.
